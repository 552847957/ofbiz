/** ParametersArtifact interface. This interface extends
 * <code>ExecutionArtifact</code> and adds the ability to
 * contain a parameter <code>Map</code>.<p>The purpose of this
 * class is to provide a way for the <code>ExecutionContext</code>
 * to keep track of what parameters are the most recent. For
 * example: Service A calls Service B. Service A has one set of
 * parameters, and Service B has another set of parameters. During
 * program execution, Service A creates a <code>ParametersArtifact</code>
 * instance that contains the service's parameters, then pushes that
 * instance on the <code>ExecutionContext</code> stack. When Service B
 * is called, it does the same thing. When framework code needs to
 * access the current parameters, it calls
 * <code>ExecutionContext.getParameters()</code>. The <code>ExecutionContext</code>
 * will search its stack for the first <code>ParametersArtifact</code> instance -
 * starting at the top of the stack, and return that instance.</p>
