    <title>Party Lists to which it is associated</title>

      <para>This portlet displays the parties to which it is associated to the selected Party. The display and behavior depend on its setting. </para>
      <para>To characterize the relationship between two parties, we must specify the "relationship type", the more fluently this portlet is used
         for a specific relationship Type, eg
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem> <para> "Contact", ie list all sales reps or customer, to which he is a contact; </para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para> "Employee", ie list all company where a person is employed; </para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para> "Team Member", ie list all team or group to which person is member; </para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para> ... </para> </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>For a relationship between Party, it is also possible to specify the role of the party associated, for example in the case of Relationship Type
         "employee", the role will detail the role of the employee in the company. In most cases this field does not appear because it is not necessary. </para>
      <para> A relationship between Party possesses validity date (from date .. thru date ..), it is possible to keep a history. Depending on the setting
             it is also possible to delete a relationship in which case the history will not be retained. </para>
      <para>&amp;nbsp;</para>
